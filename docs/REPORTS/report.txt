Performance Optimization Report
Executive Summary

This report details the significant performance improvements achieved through parallelization of image processing algorithms using OpenMP. By leveraging multi-core processors, we achieved:

    3.8x speedup for the Gaussian filter function

    2.5x speedup for rotation functions (90°, 180°, 270°)

These optimizations dramatically reduce processing time for large images while maintaining identical output quality.
1. Introduction
   1.1 Project Overview

The image processing application performs various operations on BMP images including rotation (90°, 180°, 270°) and Gaussian blur filtering. The original implementation processed images sequentially, which became a bottleneck for high-resolution images.
1.2 Performance Challenges

As image resolution increases:

    Rotation operations show O(n²) time complexity

    Gaussian filtering shows O(n²k²) complexity (where k is kernel size)

    Processing time became prohibitive for images above 4K resolution

1.3 Optimization Goals

    Leverage multi-core CPU architecture

    Achieve near-linear speedup for parallelizable operations

    Maintain pixel-perfect output accuracy

    Implement efficient memory access patterns

2. Methodology
2.1 Hardware Specifications

    CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12-core/24-thread)

    RAM: 32GB DDR4 3600MHz

    OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

2.2 Parallelization Approach

#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)
for (int i = 0; i < height; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < width; ++j) {
        // Pixel processing operations
    }
}


3.0 Comprehensive Performance Analysis Report
Executive Summary

Based on the provided performance metrics, our optimization efforts have yielded significant speed improvements:

    Gaussian Filter: 3.8× speedup (12.36s → 3.26s)

    Rotation Operations: 2.5× average speedup (0.44-0.54s → 0.16-0.23s)

These results demonstrate successful parallelization of compute-intensive image processing operations using OpenMP, enabling near real-time processing of large images.
