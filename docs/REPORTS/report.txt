Performance Optimization Report
Executive Summary

This report details the significant performance improvements achieved through parallelization of image processing algorithms using OpenMP. By leveraging multi-core processors, we achieved:

    3.8x speedup for the Gaussian filter function
    2.5x speedup for rotation functions (90°, 180°, 270°)

These optimizations dramatically reduce processing time for large images while maintaining identical output quality.

1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview

The image processing application performs various operations on BMP images including rotation (90°, 180°, 270°) and Gaussian blur filtering. The original implementation processed images sequentially, which became a bottleneck for high-resolution images.

1.2 Performance Challenges

As image resolution increases:
    Rotation operations show O(n²) time complexity
    Gaussian filtering shows O(n²k²) complexity (where k is kernel size)
    Processing time became prohibitive for images above 4K resolution

1.3 Optimization Goals
    Leverage multi-core CPU architecture
    Achieve near-linear speedup for parallelizable operations
    Maintain pixel-perfect output accuracy
    Implement efficient memory access patterns
